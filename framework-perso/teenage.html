					<span class="first-line-paragraph"></span>We usually walked to and from school. Only when the weather was bad did we ride the streetcars. There were no public buses in Montgomery then, just trolleys. These were segregated. When we black people got on, we had to go as far back in the car as we could.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<span class="first-line-paragraph"></span>There were other aspects of segregation in Montgomery that I had to get used ta. Public water Iountains were one. The public water fountains in Montgomery had signs that said &ldquo;White&rdquo; and &ldquo;Colored.&rdquo; Like millions of black children, before me and after me, I wondered if &ldquo;White&rdquo; water tasted different from &ldquo;Colored&rdquo; water. I wanted to know if &ldquo;White&rdquo; water was white and if &ldquo;Colored&rdquo; water came in different colors. It took me a while to understand that there was no difference in the water. It had the same color and taste. The difference was who got to drink it from which public fountains.

				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="first-line-paragraph"></span>Then there was another time. We lived close to sorne woods, and there was a creek and we were walking through the woods picking up sticks to take back to the house for fuewood. My brother was with us at that rime, going to school in Montgomery. A crowd of white boys, in their teens, got after us and threatened to throw my brother in the creek. He wasn’t as large as they were, but they were talking about throwing this &ldquo;big nigger&rdquo; into the creek. I got after them, saying, &ldquo;Well you won’t be putting nobody in the water unless all of us go in together.&rdquo; So they backed down after they started thinking about us pulhng them in after us. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="first-line-paragraph"></span>I don’t know if it was the same group of white boys or not, but another time my brother said that he and one of his friends were somewhere and the white boys were throwing rocks at them. So they threw some rocks back, and they hit one of the boys and all the white boys left. They soon came back with a man, maybe one of their fathers, and my brother said that the man came with his pistol and he asked the little white boy if my brother and his friend were the same ones who had thrown the rocks. My brother said he never knew why, but the little boy said, &ldquo;No, they’re not the same ones.&rdquo; Perhaps the little boy didn’t want ta admit who had hit him. Or maybe he didri’t want the black boys to be shot. My brother was about thirteen or fourteen years old. That was a very close call for him. He never did mention it at ail until we were talking orle time after we were grown. 
				</p> 
				<p>
					<span class="first-line-paragraph"></span>Those run-ins with white children were kind of common, but some of them stand out more than others. A lot of them you forget about, especially when it was only the little smart talk that they’d do. It wasn’t that the white children meant to be as cruel as they were, but they had been indoctrinated with that type of attitude by the adults around them.
